    "# NumPy and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of the NumPy package, is the `ndarray` object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard Python list is an array of pointers. NumPy arrays are fixed-size.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization in NumPy is a method of performing operations on entire arrays **without explicit loops**. This approach leverages NumPy's underlying C implementation for faster and more efficient computations. It is based on a hardware (CPU) mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparing Python loops to NumPy vectorization for addition on 1 million elements, NumPy typically performs 50x to 100x faster."
