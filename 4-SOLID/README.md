# SOLID principles

In object-oriented programming, SOLID is an acronym for 5 principles intended to make source code more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin introduced the basic principles of SOLID design in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns".

Why do we care about this thing? "Is it relevant to JavaScript? I've heard that only guys from Java/.Net should follow this".

Well, if you want to build complex systems on any language you need to have a set of abstractions, principles that will allow you to have a separation of concerns, order, structure, scalability and maintainability.

**Principles:**

- [Single responsibility principle](./1-SR/)
- [Open–closed principle]()
- [Liskov substitution principle]()
- [Interface segregation principle]()
- [Dependency inversion principle](./5-DI/)
