# UML diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, object-oriented, visual modeling language that provides a way to visualize the architecture and design of a system, like a blueprint.

Why do we need it?

Engineering is about Abstraction skill, where we need to get or of non important i favour of important things. We can imagine an ATM as a box, with an interface, with Roles of Client, Vendor, Owner, where we are focusing on data, logic, and are not focusing on the OS installed, or the shopping mall where we will physically put it, right?

## UML diagram types

You can use different services to make UMLs, one of them is [Mermaid](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/intro/index.html). It covers all basic types of UML diagrams.

I would focus on the following UML types, since they are most common:

1. Class diagrams: [https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/classDiagram.html](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/classDiagram.html). The main building block of OOD. Defines classes, properties, methods and relations between classes.
2. Entity Relationship Diagrams: [https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html). The high-level abstraction that will help you to decompose entities in your solution. Check and idea of Entity–relationship model [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) as well.
3. Sequence diagrams: [https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html). Can be helpful, for exmple, in modeling of Clint-Server communication.
4. State diagrams: [https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/stateDiagram.html](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/stateDiagram.html). If you need some state-related logic, for example some OOD things that have state.
5. Mindmap: [https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/mindmap.html#mindmap](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/mermaid-oss/syntax/mindmap.html#mindmap).

You need to use them during your SYstem Design process, they will help you a lot.
